6040,Dashi,"<p>One of the fundamental ingredients in Japanese cuisine, dashi is a type of soup and cooking stock often used as the base for different miso and noodle soups, <em>donburi</em> or rice bowl dishes, stews and many other kinds of <em>nimono</em> or simmered dishes. Dashi is typically made from <em>kombu</em> (dried kelp), <em>katsuobushi</em> (dried and smoked skipjack tuna), <em>iriko</em> or <em>niboshi</em> (anchovies or sardines), or a combination of these ingredients, all of which are naturally rich in glutamates and thus deliver an intense <em>umami</em> flavor to a number of Japanese dishes. There are several types of dashi and deciding on which kind of dashi to use for a particular dish depends solely on one's preference. <em>Awase dashi</em> is the most common all-purpose seafood-based stock made from a combination of kombu and bonito flakes. It is most often used for preparing dishes such as <em>miso soup</em>, <em>oyakodon</em>, <em>oden</em>, <em>nikujaga</em>, <em>chikuzenni</em>, <em>tamagoyaki</em>, etc. <em>Kombu dashi</em> is a vegetarian stock made exclusively with kombu; it has a mild flavor and goes well with either vegetable or fish-based dishes such as yudofu or clamp soup, as it doesn't overpower other flavors. <em>Iriko</em> or <em>niboshi dashi</em> is a seafood-based stock made from dried baby anchovies or sardines; it has a strong fishy aroma, but its flavor is not as strong. Compared to katsuobushi and kombu, this dashi is more affordable and most commonly used for making miso soup, noodle soup dishes like <em>curry udon</em> or <em>kitsune udon</em>, as well as various donburi and nimono dishes. <em>Shiitake dashi</em> is another vegetarian stock made by rehydrating dried shiitake mushrooms. It is rarely used on its own; instead, it is usually combined with other kinds of dashi to enhance the flavor and add umami to various noodle soups and simmered dishes.</p>",45000000,5.9529999999999985,0.6465,4.757,45.421025,0.1047312340485491
1287,Ceviche,"<p>Ceviche is the national dish of Peru consisting of slices of raw fish or shellfish that is spiced with salt, onions, and chili peppers, then marinated in lime juice. Due to the acidity of lime juice, the texture of the fish changes, as does its color &ndash; from pink to white. The acidic marinade, also known as<em> leche de tigre</em> (lit. tiger's milk) ""cooks"" the meat without any heat involved in the process. For ceviche, fresh fish is an imperative, as fish and shellfish that are not fresh can cause food poisoning. Peruvians are used to fresh ingredients, so the fish will sometimes be prepared for ceviche less than an hour after being caught. Fish for ceviche can be divided into three categories: firm, medium, and soft. The dish was originally made by the natives who marinated fish and <em>amarillo</em> chiles in the juices of a native fruit called <em>tumbo</em>, which was replaced by lime juice when the Spanish brought limes and onions to the country. The flavors of ceviche are slightly acidic and spicy, with an intense aroma of the sea. Traditionally, it is served on a bed of lettuce with tiny pieces of corn, chunks of sweet potato, and boiled yuca. <em>Cancha</em>, a variety of popcorn made from large corn kernels toasted in salt and oil provides an ideal side dish. The dish is traditionally served at <em>cevicherias</em>, specialized ceviche restaurants that can be found all over the country, and it is so popular that it even has its day, known as National Ceviche Day.</p>",25000000,11.42578947368421,2.696315789473684,21.804736842105264,166.4336842105263,0.1310115614248128
1731,Carpaccio,"<p>This traditional Italian dish of worldwide fame is typically served as an appetizer, and consists of very thin slices of raw fish or meat served on a plate with olive oil, cheese shavings, and lemon. Carpaccio was created in 1950 by a Venetian restaurateur named Giuseppe Cipriani, the owner of <em>Harry&rsquo;s Bar</em>, who first made the dish for Countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo, whose doctors had recommended she eat raw meat. Cipriani based the dish on a specialty from Piedmont consisting of slices of raw beef dressed with lemon juice, olive oil, and white truffle shavings. An impassioned art lover, Cipriani named the new dish carpaccio in honor of painter Vittore Carpaccio, whose style and bold colors were reminiscent of the intense red color of raw meat. Today, there are numerous modern varieties of carpaccio made with zucchini, scallops, beet, salmon, figs, and lamb, and it is said that any kind of carpaccio is best paired with a glass of wine on the side.</p>",15300000,3.251578947368421,12.253684210526316,24.571052631578947,163.92631578947368,0.14989083670455275
6149,Tataki,"<p>Tataki is the Japanese technique of preparing meat or fish, where the product is briefly seared and left raw in the middle. Most commonly, tuna steaks or beef tenderloin is employed in the tataki technique since perfect cuts allow equal searing on all sides. Meat or fish prepared tataki-style is primarily seared on all sides, then placed in an ice bath and left to chill.  It is then sliced into thin pieces and neatly arranged on a plate. Although it is often regarded as a unique technique, meat and fish products prepared in tataki-style are often served alongside other sashimi dishes. It is also commonly eaten as a single dish in traditional Japanese restaurants, where it is usually offered as an appetizer. When the meat or fish is arranged on a plate, the whole dish is usually doused in soy or ponzu sauce that is mixed with citrus juice and aromatized with grated ginger, onions, and sliced garlic. Sakamoto Ryōma, a prominent figure in Japan in the 19th century, is believed to have invented this traditional Japanese technique in the ancient province of Tosa, which is now a part of Kōchi Prefecture. The region is known for skipjack tuna (katsuo) tataki in which pieces of tuna are seared over an open flame. </p>",9000000,9.3125,8.48875,22.980625000000003,201.65625,0.11395939872927323
6099,Tandoori Chicken,"<p>Tandoori chicken is one of the most popular dishes in Indian cuisine, its name derived from the Persian word <em>tannur</em>, meaning <em>fire</em>. The dish consists of chicken meat that is marinated in yogurt, seasoned with tandoori masala, nutmeg, and cumin, then placed on skewers. It is a unique dish because of the way it is prepared - traditionally, it is cooked at high temperatures in cylindrical clay ovens called <em>tandoor</em>, resulting in succulent meat with a smokey flavor. One popular theory suggests that it was invented by a man named Kundan Lal Gujral in his restaurant <em>Moti Mahal</em> (Palace of Pearls). He wanted to make a new dish, so he tried cooking the chicken in the tandoor, which was mostly used for baking the famous Indian bread called naan. The dish was an instant hit with the hungry customers, and the crispy, yet succulent chicken dish even caught the attention of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharial Nehru, who often ate at the restaurant and made it a regular dish at official banquets. The aforementioned theory belongs to the recent past, but historians claim that tandoor-cooked chicken actually dates back to the Mughal period, when the dish was merely a part of gigantic Indian feasts at the time. Tandoori chicken's fame led to many derivatives such as <em>chicken tikka masala</em> and <em>butter chicken</em>, both of them commonly found in restaurants across the country.</p>",7600000,14.355065,9.758975,25.985095,253.26,0.10260244412856354
1292,Milanesa,"<p>Often referred to as Argentina's unofficial national dish, milanesa is a humble, yet delicious meal consisting of a breaded slice of prime beef that is fried in hot oil, curling up as it cooks, due to the fact that the chosen cuts of meat have less fat and sinew than other cuts. The dish shares many similarities with the Austrian <em>Wiener schnitzel</em> and the American <em>chicken fried steak</em>. However, milanesa has its roots in Italy, and the original dish has been traced to the city of Milan and the famous <em>cotoletta alla milanese</em>. Some claim that the best milanesa in Buenos Aires will always be prepared at home, cooked by someone's mother, although many restaurants also have it on their menus. For the pure, basic experience, it is enough to squeeze some lemon juice over it, but it is often served with a side of creamy mashed potatoes or french fries, while one of the most popular varieties is called <em>a caballo</em> (on horseback), where a fried egg is placed on top of the meat.</p>",6800000,5.984210526315789,6.721578947368421,19.226842105263156,172.73684210526315,0.1113071297989031
262,Pernil,"<p>Pernil is one of Puerto Rico's most famous dishes, a succulent roasted pork shoulder that is traditionally seasoned in a marinade called <em>adobo mojado</em>, consisting of paprika, salt, vinegar, garlic, and oregano. The name of the dish is derived from the Spanish word <em>pierna</em>, meaning <em>leg</em>, but it is also a Catalan word for <em>ham</em>, referring to the traditional recipe that calls for fresh ham. Because pork shoulder is more available and costs less than ham, it has become a key ingredient in pernil. Many people prefer it since it is believed to be much more flavorful than ham. The dish is a staple at numerous Puerto Rican festivities such as birthdays or weddings, where many people feast on the crunchy skin and tender meat that falls off the bone.</p>",5600000,1.1646842105263158,14.416315789473686,20.620526315789476,199.3684210526316,0.10342925026399157

Today, it is one of the most consumed meals in Peru, so much that 27 million Peruvians eat it daily.

1774,Steak tartare,"<p>Steak tartare is an appetizer made with finely chopped raw beef or horse meat that is seasoned with salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and either Tabasco or mustard. The meat is combined with a raw egg yolk, capers, onions, parsley, and (sometimes) chopped gherkins. When served, steak tartare is usually accompanied by toasted bread, rye bread, or french fries. It is believed that steak tartare was originally a variation on <em>beefsteack &agrave; l'Am&eacute;ricaine</em>, a dish of raw chopped beefsteak that first appeared in France at the turn of the 20th century. This variation, steak tartare, was originally served with tartar sauce, and anything that was served with it was known as <em>&agrave; la tartare</em>, hence the name.</p>",4500000,3.0410526315789475,17.748947368421053,25.91,255.10526315789474,0.10156591706210026
1793,Sauerbraten,"<p>The traditional German pot roast is one of the best ways to transform more tougher cuts of beef into a tender, succulent meal. Chuck and bottom round are most favored cuts for this German classic, while the key to a perfect sauerbraten is in its lengthy marinade of red wine, tart vinegar. and spices, which tenderizes the meat infusing it with sharp, tangy flavors. After long hours of braising, the remaining cooking liquid is whisked into <em>einbrenne</em> (roux), and finally simmered into a thick, brown gravy. Sauerbraten is traditionally served with German favorites such as <em>sp&auml;tzle</em> egg noodles, bread dumplings, or boiled potatoes and a side of braised or roasted red cabbage.</p>",4000000,11.945000000000004,6.8950000000000005,22.945,209.525,0.10950960505906217
1790,Feijoada à portuguesa,"<p>Feijoada is a hearty bean stew that appears in several local and international varieties. Although it is often assumed that feijoada originated in Brazil, where it is considered a national dish, it was primarily made in Portugal before it was introduced to Brazil. The Portuguese version is believed to have originated in the north of Portugal, but today it appears in several versions throughout the country. It is usually made with red kidney or white beans, while the additions usually include pork, beef, blood sausage (<em>morcela</em>), farinheira sausage, or chouri&ccedil;o. Some variations also include vegetables.

301,Cabrito,"<p>Cabrito is roasted goat kid, a specialty of the Mexican city of Monterrey. Apart from Mexico, the dish is also popular in Brazil, Argentina, Spain, and Portugal. Traditionally, goat kid should be no more than three weeks of age and it should never have been fed anything other than mother's milk. Those predispositions are crucial for developing good flavors in the dish. There are numerous styles of cooking cabrito, such as <em>cabrito al pastor</em> (spit-roasted, no seasonings), <em>cabrito al horno</em> (oven-roasted), <em>cabrito en sangre</em> (braised in blood with offal and seasonings), and <em>cabrito en salsa</em> (braised in tomatoes with garlic, onions, and chilis).</p>",4000000,11.918750000000001,14.249999999999998,20.11875,191.875,0.10485342019543974
314,Machaca,"<p>Machaca is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of marinated and shredded beef. The meat is usually marinated in a mixture of garlic, salt, pepper, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, and chilis. Originally, the meat was dried, rehydrated, and pounded to make it tender again. Although meat-drying is one of the oldest methods of preservation, drying the beef with native spices and chilis was invented by the people of northern Mexico. Today, shredded beef is often cooked with onions, garlic, bell peppers, and finely chopped tomatoes. With its rising popularity, there are also some variations on the recipe, so machaca can be added to burritos, prepared with scrambled eggs (<em>macahaca con huevos</em>), or slow-cooked overnight and served with cheese, sour cream, and tortillas. It is recommended to pair machaca with beverages such as tequila, White Zinfandel, or margaritas.</p>",3600000,11.923,12.6435,32.8855,289.45,0.11361375021592676
2051,Entrecôte,"<p>Entrec&ocirc;te is a type of beef steak that's cut from between the ribs, but it's more commonly known as a thin and boneless rib-eye steak. The butchers cut bone-in rib-eyes with the bone on each side, but there are also six leftover boneless steaks from the meat between each bone-in rib-eye, and they're known as the entrec&ocirc;tes. Due to the fact that these cuts are thin, it makes them great for quick cooking on the grill or in a pan (high heat), but it's important not to overcook them. The steaks are juicy, tender, and generously marbled. This type of meat cut is popular in France and Europe, and the word <em>entrec&ocirc;te</em> means <em>between the ribs</em>.</p>",3500000,0.2157894736842105,11.91578947368421,25.568421052631578,210.3684210526316,0.12154115586690016

One of the most popular meat dishes of modern Italian cuisine, these skewers were once a staple of shepherds who lived in the mountainous areas of Abruzzo, prepared merely with leftover sheep meat of lesser quality. Today, arrosticini are made with well-marbled, more tender cuts mixed with hefty chunks of ovine fat, which makes them particularly succulent. The skewers are sometimes seasoned with Mediterranean herbs, although they are more often simply generously salted to taste and then seared until almost charred. Arrosticini can be found in almost any village and town throughout the region, especially near the Gran Sasso mountain, but they are also available ready-made in numerous supermarkets. In traditional Abruzzo style, to fully enjoy the tenderness and rich flavor of grilled meat, arrosticini are served sizzling hot and are often accompanied by slices of <em>pane unto</em> - a crusty, homebaked sourdough bread that is grilled and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. As for the wine pairing, arrosticini go hand in hand with a glass of <em>Montepulciano d'Abruzzo</em>.</p>",3400000,1.5557894736842104,12.741578947368424,21.18631578947369,205.73684210526315,0.10297774366845742

The dish is often served with rice, beer, and side dishes such as fried chicken and shrimp dumplings. Chankonabe dates back to the late 19th century, when cooks from Niigata started to make meals for sumo wrestlers. It is the main course of a sumo meal, and all the wrestlers have to eat it as a part of their weight-gain diet, whether they like the dish or not. The word <em>chan</em> refers to <em>father</em>, while <em>nabe</em> refers to one-pot meals that are often served at the table. However, chankonabe is not reserved only for sumo wrestlers, as it is a nutritious and filling bowl of soup that is ideal for winter, but it should be consumed in moderation in order not to gain too much weight.</p>",3110000,27.733333333333334,5.733333333333333,31.7,285.6666666666667,0.11096849474912485
1300,Asado,"<p>Considered an epitome of Argentinean gastronomy and culture, asado (lit. roast; roasted) is much more than merely a meal. In Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and in a number of other South American countries, it is both a culinary and social event attended by friends and family to share the joy of outdoor cooking. Asado traditionally features a wide selection of grilled meats, mainly beef, which Argentina is most known for. The meat is cooked on a special brick-built grill called <em>la parrilla</em>, and the fire can either be made with charcoal (<em>parrilla al carb&oacute;n</em>) or wood (<em>parrilla a le&ntilde;a</em>) which is more typical for the countryside and known as <em>asado criollo</em>, a term that indicates a more rustic, traditional style of grilling. First to go on the grill are <em>chorizos</em> (pork sausages), <em>morcillas</em> (blood sausages), and <em>achuras</em> (offal), followed by thinner beef cuts such as <em>matambre</em> (rose) and <em>entra&ntilde;a</em> (skirt steak), which are to be grilled hot and fast, as they would otherwise dry out. As for all the other juicy asado meats, they are grilled to perfection over <em>fuego lento</em> or slow fire. Some of the most popular cuts include <em>bife de chorizo</em> (sirloin), <em>tira de asado</em> (beef chuck ribs, flanken-style), <em>bife ancho</em> (Argentine ribeye), <em>bife angosto</em> (striploin), <em>bife de costilla</em> (T-bone or porterhouse), <em>lomo</em> (tenderloin), <em>cuadril</em> (rump), and <em>vacio</em> (flank steak).

He called it Vegemite, a spread made from leftover brewers' yeast extract, spices, and vegetable additives. Its texture is thick, gluey and dense, similar to peanut butter, while its color is dark red to brown, almost black. The taste is an acquired one, as Vegemite is extremely salty.

5584,Biltong,"<p>Biltong is a traditional South African beef snack that is cured in a unique way. The word comes from the Dutch <em>bil</em>, meaning <em>hind quarter</em>, and <em>tong</em>, meaning <em>strip</em>, in this case - a strip of meat. Although it looks similar to American beef jerky, it is quite different in flavor and the method of preparation. The beef is dried with vinegar which cures the meat and adds layers of texture and flavor. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, and coriander, and the meat is much thicker than beef jerky. Originally, it was created out of necessity as a survival food when the Dutch settlers arrived in South Africa. As the climate was extremely hot, they needed to preserve the meat, so they hung it out to dry and found out that it had become hard on the exterior, yet flavorful on the inside. And so, biltong was born, enjoyed today both in South Africa and abroad as a testament to its ever-growing popularity.</p>",2350000,1.671578947368421,3.0399999999999996,35.4521052631579,173.52631578947367,0.2043039126478617

As an example of some appetizing combinations, Chinese dessert soups are often flavored with mango, pomelo, strawberries, citrus peels, pearl tapioca, or vanilla bean, peanut or black sesame paste, and almond or walnut flour. Most common tong sui toppings include ice cream, fresh fruits, and the bittersweet herbal grass jelly, while the chewy, glutinous rice dough balls called <em>tong yuan</em> are another popular addition to these soups.

1828,Sfogliatella,"<p>Sfogliatella is one of the most famous Italian pastries, with many regions offering their spin on the recipe. Although traditionally associated with Naples, it is believed that the original sfogliatella was invented around 1700 on the Italian Amalfi Coast, as a creation of nuns from the Santa Rosa monastery. This version was filled with luscious custard cream and black cherries preserved in syrup, and although the nuns were forbidden to have contact with the external world, the recipe was somehow obtained by a Neapolitan chef who started preparing his variety of these delicious sweets which soon became a Naples favorite. Nowadays, they are offered in two main varieties: <em>riccia</em> and <em>frolla</em>. Sfogliatella riccia is regarded as the traditional and the most common variety. It is an elaborate dessert made with multiple layers of paper-thin dough arranged in a clam-shaped pocket, filled with a delicious cream made with semolina, water, ricotta, sugar, eggs, cubed candied fruit, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Sfogliatella frolla has the same filling, but it is round-shaped and made with shortcrust pastry. Another version of this dessert is <em>coda d&rsquo;aragosta</em>, literally meaning<em> lobster tail</em>, filled with pastry cream. It is a very popular dessert in the United States, with their version typically being much larger than the original. Traditionally, sfogliatella should always be served freshly prepared, while still crispy, preferably warm and dusted with powdered sugar.</p>",2000000,67.11444444444444,82.03388888888888,46.352222222222224,354.8155555555556,0.13063751432669243

1877,Rouladen,"<p>Rouladen are traditional German meat rolls stuffed with a variety of ingredients. They are always served accompanied by a creamy sauce. The rolls are usually made with long and thin beef steaks, which are pounded, generously seasoned, and usually covered with a layer of sharp German mustard, which flavors them and keeps the meat juicy and tender. Traditional stuffing inside rouladen usually incorporates thin strips of bacon and sliced pickles, but there are many different regional combinations which might include carrots, onion, or bread. The steaks are typically rolled into small logs and secured with toothpicks. Rouladen are shortly seared on all sides, then braised in a flavorful mixture of wine and vegetable or meat broth. The same broth, commonly thickened with flour, is usually used as the base for a velvety sauce accompanying the rolls. Potato dumplings, braised red cabbage, mashed potatoes, <em>sp&auml;tzle</em>, different vegetables, or soft boiled potatoes can all be served as side dishes with this German classic. Even though it is believed that the name <em>roulade</em> derives from the French <em>rouler</em>, which means <em>to roll</em>, this delicacy is considered to be an authentic German dish.</p>",1950000,3.1736842105263157,9.305263157894737,22.615789473684213,190.3684210526316,0.11880011058888583

According to the 1912 imperial cookery book, tafelspitz was standard fare at the court, and ""his Majesty&rsquo;s private table was never without a fine piece of boiled beef."" The name <em>tafelspitz</em> (lit. a tip [of meat] for the table) refers to a cut from the top hind end of the cow just below the tail, though some cooks prefer to use top round or chuck for this dish, while the richest and juiciest meat comes from a leg cut called <em>beinfleisch</em>. Regardless of the cut, the meat is always simmered slowly with root vegetables. Some chicken pieces and a marrow bone may also be added to the mix, and the pot is constantly skimmed, resulting in a crystal clear broth. Traditionally, tafelspitz is eaten in separate courses: first comes the broth that's served hot in bouillon cups, followed by tender slices of beef which are usually accompanied by potatoes, carrots, and a creamy apple-horseradish and chive sauce.</p>",1800000,8.827894736842106,11.072105263157896,25.494736842105265,239.10526315789474,0.1066255778120185

When properly prepared, the meat should be succulent and very tender. The best part of pork to use for this dish is boneless pork shoulder.

The whole animal is rubbed and stuffed with a mixture of local spices such as turmeric, ginger, pepper, chili, and shrimp paste. Though the dish is nowadays mainly barbecued, the traditional procedure includes wrapping the seasoned duck or chicken in leaves, placing it in an earth oven, then steaming it over hot coals.

When served in restaurants, the server will bring all the ingredients and cook the dish for the guests. Occasionally, perilla leaves are incorporated into dak galbi, but the final addition is always a generous amount of spicy sauce made with spicy chili paste, chili flakes, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and onions. It is put on top of dak galbi and mixed until all the elements are completely coated in it. At the end of the meal, when there is still some food left in the skillet, a common tradition is for the server to add rice into the skillet and create an unusual variety of fried rice. Several vegetable side dishes are usually served alongside dak galbi, and lettuce or perilla leaves are occasionally used instead of utensils as crunchy wrappers. Dak galbi is now considered a Korean classic, but it originated as a frugal dish in the 1960s. Since then, it has spread from Chuncheon to other parts of South Korea. Although it can be prepared at home, it is typically eaten in specialized dak galbi restaurants.</p>",1400000,26.642777777777773,12.274444444444445,32.04833333333333,288.65555555555557,0.11102621348011855

The number and type of dishes which are regarded as part of anju are huge - they encompass simple salty snacks, stew-like dishes, and even fast food items. The most suitable accompaniments are usually chosen when paired with a drink. When drinking beer, Koreans prefer to eat fried and heavy dishes such as fried chicken, sausages, french fries, or grilled meat and vegetables. A strong rice liquor known as <em>soju</em> is usually paired with robust and hearty dishes such as <em>jjigae</em> stews, spicy tofu, kimchi, Korean pancakes, stir-fried seafood dishes, or grilled pork belly. Other typical food items used as anju include nuts, dried fruits, and even whole plates of fresh fruit. Convenient options also include chips, dried fish, crackers, and occasionally even some sweet treats. Depending on the occasion, environment, and type of company, anju dishes can be served as a set of different dishes (usually in smaller portions), or as one large meal that is typically shared among a group of people.

6553,Shark Fin Soup,"<p>Shark fin soup is a controversial soup with Chinese origins, made with shark fins and flavored with chicken or another type of stock. Shark fin is slightly neutral in flavor, and is used in the dish to add texture. It is believed that the first shark fin soup was invented by an emperor during the time of the Sung Dynasty who wanted to show off his power, wealth, and generosity to his guests. Because of that, preparing and serving this expensive dish is now considered a sign of respect. Today, the soup is a part of the <em>Big 4</em>, dishes that represent health and prosperity in Chinese culture, which are usually reserved for special occasions, the other three being abalone, sea cucumber, and fish maw. Shark fin soup is also a status symbol, with bowls of it ranging from $5 to $2,000, depending on the type of shark fin served in the soup. However, due to the shark finning process and the inhumane treatment of sharks which are finned alive and left in the ocean unable to swim or survive, shark fin soup is considered one of the major threats to the world's shark populations, and some organizations are still actively discouraging the consumption of this flavorful, yet controversial Chinese delicacy.</p>",1000000,5.5058823529411764,2.211764705882353,10.841176470588236,90.96999999999998,0.11917309520268482

2080,Ptichye moloko,"<p>One of Russia's most beloved desserts, <em>ptichye moloko</em> is a decadent cake famous for its reversed cake-to-filling ratio: the thick, but exceptionally light, almost souffl&eacute;-like layers of silky custard are separated by thin, fluffy, and moist layers of sponge cake, while the whole confection is topped with a rich chocolate ganache glaze. Ptichye moloko was first made in 1978 by Vladimir Guralnik, who was the head patisserie chef at Moscow's prestigious Praga restaurant. And just like the popular milk-flavored, meringue-filled candy bar that inspired Guralnik to make the cake version, the Russian ptichye moloko (lit. bird's milk) got its whimsical name as a reference to an old idiom denoting ""something so exquisite, delicate and rare it probably doesn't even exist"". Interestingly, the name caught up immediately and also seemed quite fitting, as bird's milk cake was invented during the heyday of the USSR, rapidly gaining popularity of mass proportions among the Soviet consumers despite being expensive and relatively hard to purchase at the time. In the US, this cake is still popular among Russian immigrants who often use Cool Whip and gelatin to get the right consistency.</p>",800000,29.821052631578944,17.34736842105263,14.43157894736842,129.96845263157894,0.11103909183467438

Chickens are usually fed on a diet of coconut and peanut bran, resulting in flavorful, aromatic meat. The dish is usually consumed by dipping chicken pieces in a combination of spices such as ginger and salt.

2089,Cocido Madrileño,"<p>One of the most emblematic dishes of Madrilenian cuisine known as cocido Madrile&ntilde;o is a hearty meat and chickpea stew whose origins can be traced back to the medieval-era Castilla La Mancha. Some food historians claim that this one-pot meal evolved from a peasant dish called <em>olla podrida Manchega</em>, but wasn't named cocido Madrile&ntilde;o until the 17th century. However, most sources agree that the famed dish has its roots in the Sephardic stew called <em>adafina&ndash;</em>a Shabbat kosher meal based on chickpeas, vegetables, and either hard-boiled eggs or meat such as lamb, veal, beef, or chicken. With the arrival of the Inquisition, feared of prosecution by the Catholic priests who roamed the streets of Madrid at the time&ndash;in search of both Jewish and Muslim cookery&ndash;the converted Spanish Jews called Marranos started incorporating pork into their adafinas to prove themselves as Christians. Over time, with the addition of lard, bacon, Serrano ham, <em>chorizo</em> (pork sausages) and <em>morcilla</em> (blood sausages), adafina reportedly became the dish that is now known as cocido Madrile&ntilde;o. This substantial meal is traditionally served in three separate <em>vuelcos</em> or courses: the first one is a rich, flavorful stock with added noodles; the second vuelco consists of chickpeas and vegetables, while the meat is dished out as the third course. Once commonly consumed during winter, cocido Madrile&ntilde;o can nowadays be found prepared throughout the year in many of Madrid's restaurants and taverns.</p>",600000,51.077,36.99399999999999,39.1695,361.15,0.10845770455489409

However, even though it is flavorful, unlike the majority of national dishes in Indonesia, it is not particularly spicy. Usually, the ribs are served together with the broth, but the dish can sometimes be divided in a two-course meal, when broth and ribs are served separately. There is also a dry variety of konro, when ribs are grilled and served with a sauce which tastes similar to the one used in sop konro. Both varieties are usually eaten with <em>ketupat</em>, traditional Indonesian rice cakes, packed inside the woven palm leaf packages. For the ultimate Indonesian experience, konro should be eaten with a spoonful of sambal - a traditional Indonesian chili sauce.</p>",380000,16.45,15.35,39.8,357.0,0.111484593837535

1501,Asado con cuero ,"<p>An authentic gaucho dish, asado con cuero consists of beef with its hide still attached, grilled over an open fire. This is a very old, traditional way of preparing beef that dates back to the Argentine gauchos, who roasted their beef long and slow on an <em>asador</em>, a type of metal structure, over low fire, and used quebracho wood, which is still used today as it lends a unique flavor to the meat. Large chunks of beef are first salted and then soaked overnight in a marinade made with ground chilis, pepper, cumin, chopped parsley, wine, vinegar, and oil. The following morning, the marinated beef chunks are grilled with their hide side up, over low fire for about 8 to 10 hours, or more if necessary. Beef prepared in this way is much more flavorful, tender, and moist as the hide allows the meat to preserve its juices and fat. Some trace this ritual of roasting beef with its hide even further back, to the indigenous Indians who allegedly found it convenient to prepare beef this way as it allowed them to carry the roasted meat inside the beef hide, in case they had to escape an attack. Roast beef with hide is regarded as one of the most traditional specialties of the Pampas region in Argentina.</p>

Bananas are so popular in the Caribbean that they are often used in main courses, as side dishes, or even in salads because they are not so sweet and taste similar to potatoes. As for the saltfish, cod is traditionally used, but any other salty fish can replace it. In the past, salt cod was given to slaves due to its low price and high nutritional value. Originally, slaves cooked the fish and bananas with various spices and condiments, so green fig and saltfish was created as a result. The fish had been salted for ages as a way to preserve the food for a longer period of time. Bananas are typically boiled in a deep pan and the fish is boiled and then saut&eacute;ed with cooked bananas, onions, garlic, cabbage, pepper, and tomatoes. The result is a colorful dish with spices that elevate the green bananas and provide excellent flavor. It is prepared on special occasions such as Jounen Kweyol festival in October, but also on weekends for a family lunch.</p>",7500,8.442857142857143,7.634285714285714,19.662857142857142,162.21428571428572,0.12121532364597093
